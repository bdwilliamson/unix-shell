\frametitle{Running GUI-less: some advice}
Work up code slowly!
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure your base code (e.g. \texttt{oneTest}) works correctly
\item Make sure the loop works (usually in GUI) (e.g. \texttt{permTest} with small B)
\item Make sure the looping and parameter setting works in Rscript, with small B (check output!)
\end{itemize}

Once your code passes all of these checks, \emph{then} run with a large B.
